## Lessons

Creating a GUI with Java for the first time was challenging yet rewarding. At the time, my understanding of Object-Oriented Programming was still developing, so hit-and-trial was the name of the game. This project provided me with valuable hands-on experience in building graphical user interfaces.

I gained a deeper understanding of Java's built-in functions for both basic and complex calculations. Additionally, and most importantly, I learned the importance of event handling in creating interactive applications.
